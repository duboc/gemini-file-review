# gemini-file-review
This Python code snippet demonstrates automated code review using Google's Gemini language model. It loads user code from a file, initializes the Gemini model, and generates a markdown-formatted report highlighting potential inefficiencies and poor coding practices. The report includes the location of the issue, a description, a suggestion for improvement, and the severity of the issue. If no issues are found, the code outputs "No Issues."

The code snippet is designed to be used in a serverless environment, such as Cloud Functions or App Engine. It handles HTTP requests and uses Google Cloud Logging for logging purposes.

To use the code snippet, you need to have a Gemini model deployed in Vertex AI and set the GCP_PROJECT and GCP_REGION environment variables accordingly. You also need to provide your user code in a file named user_code.txt.

Once you have set up the environment and provided the user code, you can run the code snippet to generate a code review report. The report will be printed to the console.
